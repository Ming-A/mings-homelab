# 👨‍💻 Ming's Homelab 🏡

Using [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) and [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops) to deploy the services running in my homelab. Still learning the ropes to figure out Github Actions and ArgoCD for example to integrate CI/CD. 


Will update this readme when I got more time 🤣

## 📖 Overview

Below is the topology of my current homelab where im in the progress of migrating all of my services from docker to my k8 cluster.
